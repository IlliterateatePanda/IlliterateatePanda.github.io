All you need to do is to pour hours<br> into getting better and improving your skills.<br><br><br></h2>

				<h2 class="s2w">Detail doesn't have to be everything.<br> You don't need to be an amazing artist.<br> Games come in all kinds of looks and<br> styles and there's no minimum requirement<br> you'd need to meet to make a great game.<br> Even with the simplest of looks you can<br> make a masterpiece. A great example of this<br> is a game called <a class="dlinks" href="https://badpiggy.itch.io/red-handed">Red Handed</a><br><br><br></h2>

				<h2 class="s3w">You don't have to be an amazing musician.<br> Musical talent isn't everything either, you<br> don't need a dedicated band to make music<br> for you, deep knowledge on music editing<br> software, or any number of expensive<br> equipment just to try and make your audio<br> sound better. The only thing you need is to<br> be able to record, after that you're all set.<br> A great way to prove this is the game <a class="dlinks" href="https://parrudo-productions.itch.io/pencil-peril">Pencil Peril</a> <br><br><br></h2>

					<h2 class="s4w">You don't need to be an amazing programmer<br> either. To give an example why I'll ask you this,<br> do you know of the game Undertale?<br><br> Undertale is an RPG game in which you have to<br> explore the underground and find a way back<br> to the surface. The creator of this game, TobyFox<br> was still relatively new to programming at the time<br> and it's quite evident in portions of his game.<br> Despite this he made Undertale which sold over 500k<br> copies and that number has only soared over time.<br><br>Want a look for yourself? Check it out on <a class="dlinks" href="https://github.com/fachinformatiker/undertale/tree/master/scripts">Github</a> <br><br><br></h2>
