Let's start from the beginning. The isn't a skill you need to start learning. You're in the perfect time to learn with ample resources and the internet, learning a new skill is just a few clicks away. All that you need is time and dedication, none of the games you love or the products you use in your everyday was made through talent. All you need to do is pour hours into getting better at what we do.

Detail isn't everything. You don't need to be an amazing artist. Games come in all kinds of looks and styles and there's no minimum requirement you'd need to meet to make a great game. Even with the simplest of looks you can make a masterpiece. (refer to games)

You don't have to be an amazing musician. Musical talent isn't everything either, you don't need a dedicated band to make music for you, deep knowledge on music editing software, or any number of expensive equipment just to try and make your audio sound better. The only thing you need is to be able to record, after that you're all set.

You don't need to be an amazing programmer either. To give an example why I'll ask you this, do you know of the game Undertale? Undertale is an RPG game in which you explore the underground and have to search for a way back to the surface. The creator of this game, TobyFox was still relatively new to programming at the time and it's quite evident in portions of his game. Despite this he made Undertale which sold over 500,000 copies and that number has only soared over time.
